    "In a $d$-dimensional bulk the strong invariant is responsible for appearance of a $d-1$-dimensional topologically protected state. This state can only be bound to a surface (the only $d-1$-dimensional topological defect). Defects of lower dimensionality can not be impacted by the strong invariant.
