    "First, let's consider the quantum spin-Hall insulator. As we saw two weeks ago, it is characterized by a fermion parity pump: if you take a Corbino disk made out of a quantum spin-Hall insulator and change the flux by half of a normal flux quantum, that is by $h/2e$, one unit of fermion parity is transferred from one edge to the other of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now consider a one-dimensional topological superconductor, that we studied in week two and three. There, we saw that if such a system is closed into a Josephson ring, and the flux through the ring is advanced by one superconducting quantum $h/2e$, the fermion parity at the Josephson junction connecting the two ends changes from even to odd, or viceversa. This is the $4π$ Josephson effect, one of the main signatures of topological superconductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the interesting value of flux is equal to $h/2e$ in both cases, since a superconducting flux quantum $h/2e$ is half of the normal quantum $h/e$.\n",

    "This suggest that once you have a quantum-spin Hall insulator, you are only one small step away from topological superconductivity and Majoranas. The only ingredient that is missing is to introduce superconducting pairing on the quantum spin-Hall edge.\n",

In order for this to happen a conventional $s$-wave superconductor is enough.\n",

    "The Hamiltonian above is quite anisotropic - it looks different in the $x$ and $y$ directions, a consequence of the way we derived it in week four. For our purposes, however, it is convenient to make it look isotropic. So we tweak the coefficients in $H$ to make it more isotropic, without closing the gap and hence without changing its topological properties.\n",
