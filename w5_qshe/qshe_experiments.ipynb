We will now use the  topological invariant to find a simple recipe for finding topological insulators. All we need to do is somehow vary the parity of the occupied states. One fact of nature that comes to our aid in this is that electrons in semiconductors typically occupy even parity $s$-orbitals and odd parity $p$-orbitals.\n",

This *band inversion* is the domain where we can hope to find topological insulators."
