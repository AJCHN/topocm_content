Such a gap closure at $k_x=0$, which changes the topological invariant of the system between topologically trivial and non-trivial, leads to an even parity and an odd parity state changing their occupancy.

      "You might now worry whether this definition of the invariant relied on having a smooth domain wall. But from the previous discussion, it is clear that the fermion parity pump argument that the bulk-edge correspondence implies that the bulk must be topologically non-trivial once you have edge states for any termination. Reversing this argument, we know that once we have a topologically non-trivial bulk, we must have helical edge states for any termination.\n",
