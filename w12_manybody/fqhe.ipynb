    "One obvious thing that we completely ignored throughout the course is what happens to topology in presence of interactions. It is of course possible to generalize all the symmetry classes that we have studied to many-body Hamiltonians, but what happens to the classification of the topological phases?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first statement we should make here is that our work so far wasn't wasted: most of the usual topological insulators turn out to tolerate interactions as long as the interactions do not spontaneously break the symmetry, or close the bulk gap.\n",
    "There are interesting cases where the classification collapses, so for example the 1D BDI chain containing Majorana fermions on one of the two sublattice degrees of freedom, allows a $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification with interactions instead of $\\mathbb{Z}$. The reason for this is that the 8-Majorana interaction term doesn't break the symmetries anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this is relatively small compared to the real can of worms that the interactions open: the amount of possibilities for the interacting phases is much larger, and as a beginning we'll discuss the oldest known example of a strongly interacting topological phase, the fractional quantum Hall effect. Note that it only covers a single dimension ($D=2$), and a single symmetry class (no symmetry at all). Yet, classifying all such states turns out to be a very hard task."

    "Before we approach the classification of topological insulators in presence of symmetries, let's discuss the fractional quantum Hall effect. In fact, there are a whole bunch of fractional quantum Hall states, so there is clearly room for classification. However, at first glance it looks more challenging because we cannot really solve general two dimensional interacting Hamiltonians. The tool that is used to understand what phases might exist is braiding. Based on all the examples of two-dimensional topological states with no symmetry that we have so far, it is believed that distinct topological states are characterized by distinct particle-like anyonic excitations with distinct topological properties. It is certainly obvious that if two states have topologically distinct excitations in the bulk they cannot be adiabatically deformed into one another, since the braiding rules cannot change continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the basic rule of the game is to ask what are all possible braiding rules for excitations in two dimensions. One would think that it would simply be arbitrary. Turns out that the situation is not quite as bad - locality and unitarity put rather strong constraints on the possible braids of particles. The answer is obtained through a branch of mathematics called modular tensor category theory and the theory tells us that valid sets of fractional excitations must obey the so-called pentagon and hexagon equations. All this being said, not all solutions of these equations are known - so basically the set of possible phases is not quite known. And this is all very abstract - and not even all the abstractly known phases that have acceptable braiding rules are known to be realized in nature. In fact, so far most of the known phases seem to be composite fermion ones that are well-understood."

    "\n",
    "To approach the classification of interacting topological insulators with symmetries, we can start by playing the same game as Kane and Mele, and combine two fractional quantum Hall states (instead of integer ones) to make a fractional topological insulator. If we choose a pair of FQH states which are related by time-reversal and stack them together for spin-up and spin-down electrons, that technically leads to a time-reversal invariant state. The key question that needs to be asked is whether one can gap out the edge states by adding time-reversal invariant perturbations. If one can do that then the state, unlike the Kane-Mele quantum spin Hall state, is not a phase that is protected by just time-reversal symmetry. This question is not too mathematically involved, though still beyond this course and can be answered by the bosonization technique as was done by [Stern and Levin](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2769).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can however explain the result. If one stacks the two FQH states one obtains a spin-Hall conductance $\\sigma_{sh}$, which is equal to the Hall conductance of each layer. Let the smallest charge of an excitation of our phase to be $e^*$, some fraction of electron charge. It turns out that the edge states are protected from gapping by time-reversal invariant perturbations if and only if $\\sigma_{sh}/e^*$ is an odd integer. This gives some idea as to what kind of interacting analogues of quantum spin Hall states one may get. But again as with the non-symmetric case, the general classification is still up in the air. More importantly, we don't really have realistic candidates for such states yet."
