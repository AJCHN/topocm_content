      "At this point, you might feel cheated - but you have to believe me that the fractionalization of the Hall effect is one of the most amazing and deepest phenomena in condensed matter physics. If you remember back to week 3, we used the pumping argument in the Hall effect to establish that the Hall effect in an incompressible liquid would be quantized in integers. You might now wonder if the experimental evidence for the fractional quantum Hall effect completely invalidates this argument in some way. The key step in the argument was to realized that the pumped charge that resulted from the insertion of one flux quantum $\\Phi_0$ into a Corbino geometry is \n",

      "\n",
      "The real reason that the charge transferred had to be an integer multiple of the electron was that the Hamiltonian for the electrons was identical between flux $\\Phi=0$ and flux $\\Phi=\\Phi_0$. Since the system is incompressible, it is reasonable to assume that all excitations in the system are local. Usually we expect different excited states to differ by rearranging electrons. Within this framework, such excitations can differ by integer multiples of electronic charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of a fractional values of $\\nu$ implies that the edge can have local excitations that differ by a fractional charge of an electron. In principle, the inner edge of the Corbino geometry can be shrunk to a point. The conclusion of this argument is the first stunning feature of the FQHE - i.e. the ground state of an FQH system (whatever the microscopic origin) supports excitations with fractional electronic charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fractional charged excitations are local particles just like the electrons themselves. So we can ask about the statistics under exchange of two such particles. On performing such an exchange the total many-body wave-function of the system returns to itself, but\n",
      "the wave-function can pick up a Berry phase. For fermions this phase is $\\pi$ and for Bosons it is zero. Instead of computing the phase directly, let us consider doing a double exchange, which is topologically equivalent to taking a particle around another one and computing the phase for that. \n",

      "Let us first consider one of the particles to be created by a flux quantum. Since the flux quantum created this particle adiabatically by a pumping process, locality dictates that the particle going around the flux quantum + particle cannot know about the existence of the particle. Thus the phase from going around a particle together with its flux quantum must vanish. On the other hand, the particle picks up a phase of $2\\pi \\nu$ from just going around the flux quantum. Thus double exchange of a pair of particles leads to a Berry phase of $-2\\pi\\nu$. This is a further strange property that we have concluded for the excitations in the FQH state! They must have statistics that is different from both fermions or bosons and are referred to as anyons. Turns out that the exchange phase of the anyons in the simple FQH states are given by \n",

      "The most stunning feature of the FQH state is topological degeneracy. We have seen an example of topological degeneracy in the Majorana wires, where the degeneracy of the zero modes could not be lifted by any perturbation. Technically, however, particle-hole symmetry played a role in protecting that degeneracy. We could argue that particle-hole was not a physical symmetry in a superconductor and so it could never be broken. Nonetheless the degeneracy would be spoiled if there were fermions floating around.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you learned in week 3 and was re-emphasized in later weeks, the quantum Hall effect does not rely on any symmetries of the system. So if the FQH state supported a topological degeneracy, we could expect it to be truly topological in the sense of not relying on any symmetry what-so-ever. Let us now try to convince ourselves that there must be such a degeneracy. To do this, we turn around the argument for computing the statistics of particles and consider the statistics of fluxes. A particle going around a flux acquires a phase of $2\\pi\\nu$. As noted in the last unit, the combination of a particle and flux does not have any non-trivial exchange statistics. So replacing the particle by another flux will lead to a phase of $-2\\pi \\nu$. Therefore the exchange phase of fluxes is $\\pi\\nu$ just as with the particles.\n",
