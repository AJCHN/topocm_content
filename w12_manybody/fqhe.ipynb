      "\n",
      "At this point, you might feel cheated - but you have to believe me that the fractionalization of the Hall effect is one of the most amazing and deepest phenomena in condensed matter physics. If you remember back to week 3, we used the pumping argument in the Hall effect to establish that the Hall effect in an incompressible liquid would be quantized in integers. You might now wonder if the experimental evidence for the fractional quantum Hall effect completely invalidates this argument in some way. The key step in the argument was to realized that the pumped charge that resulted from the insertion of one flux quantum $\\Phi_0$ into a Corbino geometry is \n",

      "\n",
      "The real reason that the charge transferred had to be an integer multiple of the electron was that the Hamiltonian for the electrons was identical between flux $\\Phi=0$ and flux $\\Phi=\\Phi_0$. Since the system is incompressible, it is reasonable to assume that all excitations in the system are local. Usually we expect different excited states to differ by rearranging electrons. Within this framework, such excitations can differ by integer multiples of electronic charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of a fractional values of $\\nu$ implies that the edge can have local excitations that differ by a fractional charge of an electron. In principle, the inner edge of the Corbino geometry can be shrunk to a point. The conclusion of this argument is the first stunning feature of the FQHE - i.e. the ground state of an FQH system (whatever the microscopic origin) supports excitations with fractional electronic charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fractional charged excitations are local particles just like the electrons themselves. So we can ask about the statistics under exchange of two such particles. On performing such an exchange the total many-body wave-function of the system returns to itself, but\n",
      "the wave-function can pick up a Berry phase. For fermions this phase is $\\pi$ and for Bosons it is zero. Instead of computing the phase directly, let us consider doing a double exchange, which is topologically equivalent to taking a particle around another one and computing the phase for that. \n",

      "Let us first consider one of the particles to be created by a flux quantum. Since the flux quantum created this particle adiabatically by a pumping process, locality dictates that the particle going around the flux quantum + particle cannot know about the existence of the particle. Thus the phase from going around a particle together with its flux quantum must vanish. On the other hand, the particle picks up a phase of $2\\pi \\nu$ from just going around the flux quantum. Thus double exchange of a pair of particles leads to a Berry phase of $-2\\pi\\nu$. This is a further strange property that we have concluded for the excitations in the FQH state! They must have statistics that is different from both fermions or bosons and are referred to as anyons. Turns out that the exchange phase of the anyons in the simple FQH states are given by \n",

      "The most stunning feature of the FQH state is topological degeneracy. We have seen an example of topological degeneracy in the Majorana wires, where the degeneracy of the zero modes could not be lifted by any perturbation. Technically, however, particle-hole symmetry played a role in protecting that degeneracy. We could argue that particle-hole was not a physical symmetry in a superconductor and so it could never be broken. Nonetheless the degeneracy would be spoiled if there were fermions floating around.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you learned in week 3 and was re-emphasized in later weeks, the quantum Hall effect does not rely on any symmetries of the system. So if the FQH state supported a topological degeneracy, we could expect it to be truly topological in the sense of not relying on any symmetry what-so-ever. Let us now try to convince ourselves that there must be such a degeneracy. To do this, we turn around the argument for computing the statistics of particles and consider the statistics of fluxes. A particle going around a flux acquires a phase of $2\\pi\\nu$. As noted in the last unit, the combination of a particle and flux does not have any non-trivial exchange statistics. So replacing the particle by another flux will lead to a phase of $-2\\pi \\nu$. Therefore the exchange phase of fluxes is $\\pi\\nu$ just as with the particles.\n",

However, the $T_1-$eigenvalue would differ so that $|\\Psi\\rangle$ and $|\\Psi'\\rangle$ would be orthogonal, but degenerate states.

The amazing fact is that experiment suggests that the FQH state really does exist in a system which is as simple as a 2D electron gas in a magnetic field. Laughlin used a representation of the many-electron wave-function in complex coordinates to write a wave-function of an incompressible state. We will instead follow the more intuitive \"Composite Fermion\" approach due to Jain to understanding this state. \n",

As we noticed in week 3, the strange feature of the Landau levels is that they are all at exactly the same energy. The simplest family of FQH states are ones where the lowest Landau level states are only partially filled. Since there is no kinetic energy, the state is determined entirely by optimizing the Coulomb repulsion by being as far away from each other.\n",

An electron going around the vortex would pick up a $\\pi$-phase shift. On the other hand, an electron could go around a double vortex and pick up effectively no (i.e. $2\\pi$) phase shift. However, the electron does feel a phase gradient or a vector potential ${\\bf A}={\\bf\\nabla}\\varphi$ as it goes around the vortex. Such a vector potential is like a magnetic field and repels the electron. \n",

      "## General classification of topological states\n",
      "\n",
      "The fractional quantum Hall states are clearly a new set of states that are topologically distinct from the non-interacting states. These states are not contained in the non-interacting classification that we talked about in week 8. Since we were so successful in classifying the non-interacting states we might be tempted to demand a classification of all topological states. So far this is still work in progress and in fact, we don't even have a large family of interacting topological states beyond two dimensions to reasonably ask about classification. The answer in one and two dimensions is better understood at least in the most robust case of no symmetries. \n",
      "\n",
      "The answer in one dimension turns out to be discouraging. It turns out that all ground states of one dimensional Hamiltonians can be deformed into those of trivial non-topological Hamiltonians. We can get  a basic idea for why this is so by considering any gapped short ranged Hamiltonian. In one dimension fermions are equivalent to bosons, since one cannot really do an exchange of particles without interacting with each other. So we can always replace the statistical phase by an interaction phase. The bottom-line is that Fermion systems are not qualitatively different from spin chains - in fact they are directly related by the Jordan-Wigner transformation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Spin chains are therefore the canonical one dimensional systems and we can understand many generic phenomena from them, including why there aren't topological state. For any such system, say spin-$1/2$ for definiteness, we can add a strong magnetic field to the Hamiltonian on groups of sites and effectively completely polarize the spins on that group of sites. In the process of doing this, we might run into a gap closure in that small group of sites. But since the Hamiltonian is local we can create an avoided crossing by an appropriate local term in the Hamiltonian.  This allows us to split the spin chain into two chains separated by a relatively trivial block of spin polarized sites. Ultimately, this procedure when repeated can be used to deform the spin-chain into a trivial state of entirely polarized spins. The one exception are Majorana fermions. They manage to slip through this noose of a logic by a loophole in the Jordan-Wigner transformation - that we cannot go into detail here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two dimensions is of course more interesting. We know there are the integer quantum Hall states and the fractional quantum Hall states. In fact, there are a whole bunch of fractional quantum Hall states, so there is clearly room for classification. However, at first glance it looks more challenging because we cannot really solve general two dimensional interacting Hamiltonians. The tool that is used to understand what phases might exist is braiding. Based on all the examples of two-dimensional topological states with no symmetry that we have so far, it is believed that distinct topological states are characterized by distinct particle-like anyonic excitations with distinct topological properties. It is certainly obvious that if two states have topologically distinct excitations in the bulk they cannot be adiabatically deformed into one another. If they could we wouldn't know what to do with the braiding. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the basic rule of the game is to ask what are all possible braiding rules for excitations in two dimensions. One would think that it would simply be arbitrary. Turns out that this is not quite as bad - locality and unitarity puts rather strong constraints on the possible braids of particles. The answer is obtained through a branch of mathematics called modular tensor category theory and the theory tells us that valid sets of fractional excitations must obey the so-called pentagon and hexagon equations. All this being said, not all solutions of these equations are known - so basically the set of possible phases is not quite known. And this is all very abstract - and not even all the abstractly known phases that have acceptable braiding rules are known to be realized in nature. In fact, so far most of the known phases seem to be composite fermion ones that are well-understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fractional topological insulators\n",
      "\n",
      "Can we play the same game as Kane and Mele and stack fractional quantum Hall states (instead of integer ones) to make fractional topological insulators? The answer is we certainly can. If we choose a pair of FQH states which are related by time-reversal and stack them together for spin-up and spin-down electrons, that technically leads to a time-reversal invariant state. The key question that needs to be asked is whether one can gap out the edge states by adding time-reversal invariant perturbations. If one can do that then the state, unlike the Kane-Mele quantum spin-Hall state, is not a phase that is protected by just time-reversal symmetry. This question is not too mathematically involved, though still beyond this course and can be answered by Bosonization as was done by Stern and Levin. We can however explain the result. If one stacks the two FQH states one obtains a spin-Hall conductance $\\sigma_{sh}$, which is equal to the Hall conductance of each layer. Stern and Levin found that the edge states were protected from gapping by time-reversal invariant perturbations if and only if $\\sigma_{sh}/e^*$, where $e^*$ was the smallest charged excitations supported by each layer was an odd integer. This gives some idea as to what kind of interacting analogues of quantum spin Hall states one may get. But again as with the non-symmetric case, the general classification is still up in the air. More importantly, we don't really have candidates for such states yet."
