      "## General strategy to construct a lattice model for the Quantum Hall Effect\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, we started by a phenomenological description of the quantum Hall effect. We learned that one way to get a quantum Hall state would be to place electrons in an external magnetic field. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we still don't have a simple lattice Hamiltonian describing this effect like the Kitaev model. Such a lattice model, in its simplest incarnation would not have an external magnetic field. If we can construct such lattice models showing the quantum Hall effect without a magnetic field, which are also referred to as Chern insulators, then we would also have a model for a material that could host the amazing properties of the quantum Hall effect without having to put it in a strong magnetic field. F. D. M. Haldane, from who we will hear in the next section constructed the first such model for a Chern insulator. However, in this section, we will use a more natural route that fits better into the context of our course so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we will do to get a model for a Chern insulator is to follow the \"domino prescription\" as we did to get the Kitaev model in week 1. To follow this strategy we need to identify two key aspects of the bulk-boundary correspondence (a) the unique property of the quantum Hall edge that cannot exit in isolation (in analogy to the Majorana modes) and (b) we need to find a one dimensional system that can host pairs of these edges (in analogy to the 0D superconducting quantum dot). From last week it is clear that the \"chiral edge state\" is the unique property in the bulk edge correspondence for the quantum Hall effect. If we can satisfy (b), then we can follow the domino prescription and couple the edges in pairs as we did with Majorana modes and be left with a pair of separated chiral edge states as in the Hall case. Voila - just like with the Kitaev chain, we have a model for 2D quantum hall state.\n",

      "## Getting a one dimensional wire with a pair of edge states\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's leave this latter aspect for the next section and focus on finding a one dimensional system with a pair of edge states.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might guess that the easiest way to get a pair of edge states moving in opposite direction is to take usual one dimensional electrons  with an effective mass. Such a system has a parabolic dispersion and the low energy excitations at a finite fermi wave-vector $k=\\pm k_F$ move in opposite directions. The catch is that this pair of states occur at different momenta and it is tricky (though not impossible) to deal with momentum conservation when pairing the edges. So we will avoid this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next guess we make is based on a model that we have already encountered, which has a pair of opposite propagating chiral states, i.e. the Dirac model $H= k \\tau_y\\Delta$, which  the Kitaev chain at the topological phase transition. More specifically, we wrote the Kitaev Hamiltonian in momentum space in week 1 as $H(k)=-(2 t\\cos{k}+\\mu)\\tau_z+\\Delta \\sin{k}\\tau_y.$ At the critical point $\\mu=-2t$, we found that the Kitaev Hamiltonian to be \n",

      "\n",
      "Considering the phase transition point of a lower dimensional model turns out to be a fairly generic strategy to construct higher dimensional topological model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at $H$ we see that we now have a pair of chiral edges one for each value of $\\tau_y=\\pm 1$ that the matrix $\\tau_y$ may take. So all we have to do is to \"couple\" the $\\tau_y=-1$ branch of one wire to the $\\tau_y=+1$ branch of the wire on the left  and we will have a quantum Hall state. The term $(2 t\\cos{k}+\\mu)\\tau_z$ which is already in the 1D Hamiltonian couples the branches on the same edge and is not what we are interested in. You might also worry at this point that the Kitaev model has superconductivity. But this is not an issue because we can interpret $\\tau_{x,y,z}$ as a lattice degree of freedom instead of the actual particle-hole degree of freedom, similar to what we did with the SSH model in assignments of week 1."

      "Let us now couple the wires to get quantum Hall system as promised. The idea is the same as the domino principle we used for Majoranas. We tune each 1D wire to the phase transition so that there are a pair of chiral modes one going left ($\\tau_y=+1$) and one going to the right ($\\tau_y=-1$). We then take an array of wires and pair them on the inside. If we take a large (ideally infinite) array we have a true two dimensional system.\n",

The other phase with $\\gamma=0$, but $\\mu> -2 t$ is even easier to understand. It is just the trivial phase obtained by stacking a bunch of gapped 1D chains next to each other without any tunneling between them. This is a trivial phase with no edge states.
