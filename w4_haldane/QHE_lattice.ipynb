      "* Let us now try to construct an explicit lattice model for a quantum Hall system. Last week, we saw that a chiral edge state was a unique property that could only exist in a quantum Hall system and never in isolation. We can understand this by realizing that the particles in a chiral edge state all move in the same direction. Particle conservation of course requires a stream of particles to move in the other direction as well. So,  as a matter of principle it should be possible to produce a pair of chiral edges moving in opposite direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Our strategy to construct the lattice model for Quantum Hall will be to follow the \"domino prescription\" for constructing isolated Majorana modes in the Kitaev chain in week 1.  By analogy, suppose we can get 1D systems with a pair of chiral edge modes. We then place an array of these 1D systems down to make a 2D system. We then pair the chiral edges between the 1D systems in a way so that we are left with chiral edges. Voila - just like with the Kitaev chain, we have a model for 2D quantum hall state.\n",

      "\n",
      "* You might think that the easiest way to get a pair of edge states moving in opposite direction is to take electrons in a parabolic dispersion at a finite fermi energy. The low energy excitation at $k=\\pm k_F$ do move in opposite directions. Unfortunately, they occur at different momenta - so while this can be made to work - it's tricky to deal with the momentum conservation aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "* On the bright side, we have already encountered a model with a pair of opposite propagating chiral states - i.e. the Dirac model $H=\\Delta k \\tau_y$, which  the Kitaev chain near the topological phase transition. More specifically, the Kitaev Hamiltonian in momentum space was written as $H(k)=-(2 t\\cos{k}+\\mu)\\tau_z+\\Delta \\sin{k}\\tau_y.$ At the critical point $\\mu=-2t$, the Hamiltonian takes a form $$H=-2t(1-\\cos{k})\\tau_z+\\Delta\\sin{k}\\tau_y.$$\n",
      "\n",
      "* From the Hamiltonian it is clear that we now have a pair of chiral edges one for each value of $\\tau_y=\\pm 1$ that the matrix $\\tau_y$ may take. So all we have to do is to \"couple\" the $\\tau_y=-1$ branch of one wire to the $\\tau_y=+1$ branch of the wire on the left  and we will have a quantum Hall state. The term $(2 t\\cos{k}+\\mu)\\tau_z$ which is already in the 1D Hamiltonian couples the branches on the same edge and is not what we are interested in. You might also worry at this point that the Kitaev model has superconductivity. But this is not an issue because we can interpret $\\tau_{x,y,z}$ as a lattice degree of freedom instead of the actual particle-hole degree of freedom."

To see this, let us calculate the bandstructure using Bloch's theorem (i.e. replacing $|n_y\\rangle\\rightarrow e^{i k_y n_y}$. This leads us to the 2D Bloch Hamiltonian   $$H(k_x,k_y)=[-(\\mu+2t\\cos{k_x})\\tau_z+\\Delta\\sin{k_x}\\tau_y]+\\gamma[e^{i k_y}(\\tau_z+i\\tau_x)+h.c].$$ This can be rewritten as $H(k_x,k_y)=[-(\\mu+2t\\cos{k_x})\\tau_z+\\Delta\\sin{k_x}\\tau_y]+2\\gamma[\\cos{k_y}\\tau_z+\\sin{k_y}\\tau_x].$ The energy spectrum $$E(k_x,k_y)=\\pm\\sqrt{\\Delta^2\\sin{k_x}^2+(2\\gamma-(\\mu+2t\\cos{k_x}))^2+4\\gamma^2\\sin^2{k_y}}.$$ The spectrum is clearly gapped.\n",

      "* As with the Kitaev chain we expect two phases. One is the phase with $\\mu=2t$ and a non-zero value of $\\gamma\\neq 0$, which as we saw had chiral edge states. Clearly another phase with $\\gamma=0$, but $\\mu> 2 t$ is just a phase with bunch of decoupled gapped 1D chains and therefore is a trivial phase with no edge states. Therefore there is a topologically trivial and non-trivial phases.\n",

      "\n",
      "* As with Kitaev chains, the Dirac model gives us another way to construct chiral edge states at the domain wall between topological and non-topological phases. Fixing either $k_x$ or $k_y$ to zero we obtain a zero-mode at the domain wall between $m<0$ and $m>0$. Perturbation theory can be used to check that the domain wall modes are chiral and move in the correct direction. This approach has the advantage of being able to prove the existance of the chiral edge states along each of the 4 edge directions."
