    "At this point, you might be wondering how did we get from talking about topological insulators to disordered metals. Well, we told you several times that topological states are supposed to be robust to disorder, and that this is one of the main reasons why they are so interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the arguments we made in previous weeks, you could convince yourselves that certain properties such as the bulk boundary correspondence would be robust as long as the disorder wasn't enough to close the gap. However, many topological properties that we measure could in principle be susceptible to disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, while we told you that there was a perfectly conducting edge state for two dimensional topological insulators that was robust to disorder, we didn't make any such claims about conductance for the surface state of topological insulators in three dimensions. In fact, the conductance in three dimensions is certainly susceptible to disorder, however topology forbids it to become zero. Such subtle properties require a more detailed understanding of disorder."

    "The main distinction that we need to keep in mind when we speak of disorder in electronic system is that between extended and localized states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by thinking of a three dimensional metal with a low density of impurities, hence weak disorder. In this limit, electrons moving through the system are scattered by impurities only every now and then, and move ballistically between collisions. This picture is known as the [Drude model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model), and yields a conductivity given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma=n e^2\\tau/m,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the electron density, $m$ is the electron mass and $\\tau$ the mean free time between collisions. In this limit, the electron wave functions are extended throughout the bulk of the system, much like the plane waves of a clean crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other extreme is the strong disorder limit, when there is a strongly fluctuating random potential in the material, for instance due to a strong density of impurities. This potential has minima at random positions in the material, where electrons can become trapped. The corresponding wave functions are localized exponentially close to the minima. With a large density of impurities, all electronic states are of this type. Once you have localized state, the only mechanism for conduction is tunneling between different minima - which however might be very far apart from each other. This leads to a suppression of conductance and to an insulating state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss qualitatively the simplest effect of strong disorder on topological states, which are gapped. If we imagine a disorder potential with a Gaussian distribution, there always are \"rare regions\" where the disorder potential is very deep. Such potentials will determine the presence of energy levels in the middle of the gap. For strong disorder, there might even be no energy gap at all! However, the electrons trapped in the rare regions are localized and do not participate in any of the transport properties of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Thus, even weak disorder can close the energy gap, which is what is supposed to protect topology, as discussed so far.  However, since these localized states are isolated from each other and most importantly the edges, they do not affect any of the topological properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The considerations above make it clear that the presence or absence of a band gap is not a good criterion to tell whether a system in insulating or not in the presence of strong disorder, and that we need to understand the nature of the electronic states in the system. Our definition of an insulating state must obey a new criterion. As will see next, this criterion can be obtained by the study of conductance as a function of the system size."

    "How can we really get away with understanding electrons in disordered potentials without doing any real quantum mechanical calculation? We can only do this in these two extreme limits and actually only in certain dimensions. In principle, to see how the \"transition\" happens from electrons being extended to localized as disorder is increased requires us to solve the full quantum problem. So far it seems impossible to exactly solve this problem in any dimension other than 1D, so we won't bother and instead discuss an educated guess, which gives us most of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by being more specific and asking about the conductance $G(L)$ of a $d$-dimensional block with sides $L$. Apart from the fact that the conductance has units of $G_0=e^2/h$, the conductance represents the ease with which electrons can propagate through the block. Therefore, the dimensionless conductance $g(L)=G(L)/G_0$ is sort of a higher dimensional analog of the average transmission of electrons between the end of the system multiplied by the number of channels. If we take the analogy with transmission a bit seriously, we could guess that the conductance of a combination of blocks each with conductance $g(L)$ would have a conductance $g'$, whose value essentially depends on the conductance $g(L)$. This is not very different from what we expect classically. The conductivity $g'$ of a pair of metallic blocks each with conductivity $g(L)$ when connected in series gives us  a $g'=g(L)/2$ when in  parallel produces a conductance of $g'=2 g(L)$. \n",

Of course, we don't quite know the function $\\beta$, but as we will see in the next unit, it is possible to guess the form in various limits and this is enough to guess qualitative behavior of the conductance.\n",

In the strongly localized limit $g\\sim g_c e^{-L/\\xi}$ so that $\\beta(g)=\\textrm{ln}(g/g_c)$, while in the weak scattering limit, we can estimate $g$ from the classical Drude formula so that $g\\sim L^{(d-2)}$ and $\\beta(g)\\sim d-2$.
