      "At this point, you might be wondering how did we get from talking about topological insulators to disordered metals. Well, we told you that topological states are supposed to be robust to disorder. Based on the arguments we made in previous weeks, you could convince yourselves that certain properties such as the bulk boundary correspondence would be robust as long as the disorder wasn't enough to close the gap. But many topological properties that we measure could in principle be susceptible to disorder. For example, while we told you that there was a perfectly conducting edge state for two dimensional topological insulators that was robust to disorder, we didn't make any such claims about conductance for the surface state of topological insulators in three dimensions. The conductance in three dimensions is certainly susceptible to disorder, however the conductance is forbidden from becoming zero. Such subtle properties require a more detailed understanding of disorder. Actually, some aspects of the role of disorder are not so subtle. When we think about certain conventional models for disorder, we find that even our simple argument for the robustness of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological states is flawed. Unbounded disorder always has a small probability of being a large perturbation in some small part of the sample. This can in principle close the gap in the topological system in those rare regions. However, again based on arguments we will encounter in this week, these rare region effects typically do not affect the bulk-boundary correspondence. What we will eventually find is that it's not really the gap that protects topological states in disordered systems but rather extended states.\n",

      "Let us first start by trying to understand the role of weak disorder in a three dimensional metal, where disorder has the weakest effect. Such weak disorder only leads to scattering of the electrons at a low enough rate that one can understand the conduction by electrons in the classical Drude model. Within the Drude model, the applied voltage raises the momentum  $\\bf p$ of the electrons according to $d{\\bf p}/dt=e {\\bf E}$. After each collision, which is separated by a mean-scatttering time $\\tau$ the electron momentum is completely randomized. In this limit, the conductivity of an electron gas is given by \n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\sigma=n e^2\\tau/m,$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $n$ is the electron density and $m$ is the electron mass. The states in this system remain extended, though conductance is as if the electrons are diffusing according to the Drude model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other extreme is the strong disorder limit which we can imagine as being generated by a \"low\" density of random and strong local impurity potential in the metal. The impurity potential then traps an electron. If the density of impurities are large compared to the number of electrons then we have a classical picture where all the electrons are trapped at the impurities. In this limit the conductance is driven by hopping of electrons between the impurity bound states. So we basically get an almost insulating state where all electrons are localized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us briefly discuss the simplest effect disorder has on topological states, which are gapped. If we imagine a disorder potential with a Gaussian distribution, there always are \"rare regions\" where the disorder potential is very deep. Such potentials trap electrons inside the gap. However, just like the strong disorder case, the electrons trapped in the rare regions are localized and do not participate in any of the transport properties of the material. Thus, the gap is technically closed by any amount of disorder because there is always a finite density of states known as the Lifshitz tail inside the gap. However, since these electrons are isolated from themselves and most importantly the edges, they do not affect any of the topological properties. "

      "You might begin to wonder how can we really get away with understanding electrons in disordered potentials without doing any real quantum mechanical calculation. Well, we can only do this in the two extreme limits and actually only in certain dimensions. In principle, to see how the \"transition\" happens from electrons being extended to localized as disorder is increased requires us to solve the full quantum problem. We can't solve this problem in anything other than 1D and we won't bother and instead discuss an educated guess which turns out to be correct.\n",

To define unambiguously the problem of our interest we define the dimensionless conductance $g(L)$ as just the conductance $G(L)$ of a $d-$dimensional block of size $L$ in units of the quantum of conductance $G_0=2 e^2/h$. Intuition for conductance is somewhat harder to build, on the other hand, we might reasonably guess following Thouless that the dimensionless conductance $g(L)$ defines a mean \"escape\" or \"Thouless time\" for an electron in the middle of the block which is connected to leads outside. This escape time defines a mean \"Thouless energy\" $\\delta E(L)$ in terms of broadening of levels in the block when connected to leads or other blocks.
