When people first made the chemical periodic", "table, some elements were not yet discovered. Nevertheless, they conjectured the existence", "of undiscovered chemical elements together with possible chemical properties.", "And in fact, later they were experimentally discovered.", "One may say we are in a somewhat similar situation here. This table unifies many known existing", "topological states of matter. However, there are also undiscovered topological states of", "matter predicted by the periodic table.", "For example symmetry class CI in three dimensions: the table says there is a non-trivial topological", "superconductor here, and symmetry class CI is a symmetry class of singlet superconductors", "with time-reversal symmetry.
