    "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is another tool to image surface states in a topological insulator. In the process of STM we tunnel electrons into the surface from a metallic tip. In contrast to ARPES, the electrons are not going into free space, so we don't have momentum resolution. On the other hand, we do trade momentum resolution for nearly atomic spatial resolution. We know exactly where exactly on the surface the electron came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tunneling into a uniform surface can tell us a little bit about which orbital on an atom the electrons at a certain energy come from. Otherwise, we'd see a uniform surface, which wouldn't have much information.  We can make things more interesting and, strangely enough, get more information out, by sprinkling some impurities on the surface. The impurities scatter the surface electrons and produce a standing wave pattern on the surface, which depends on the Fermi surface momenta of the electrons at the particular tunneling energy (Note: in this unit we refer to the equal energy surface in momentum space at the tunneling energy as Fermi surface for convenience). The resulting pattern is referred to QPI. Specifically, Fourier transforming the QPI pattern directly maps out the momentum transfer across the Fermi-surface of the surface state. \n",

    "In fact, by comparing the fourier transform of the QPI on the right with the Fermi surface on the left, we begin to see that the absence of back-scattering, which is one of the key properties of the topological insulator surface state plays a key role. As you might remember from the quantum spin hall systems - elastic backscattering of electrons is forbidden between states at $\\bf k$ and $-\\bf k$ because of Kramers' theorem. Looking at the QPI pattern from spin-independent impurities and comparing it with the Fermi surface confirms this. "

    "What you see is that the Fermi-energy, which is the highest energy till which you can eject electrons in ARPES intersects the conduction band. This means that in the native state the conduction band of the electrons is occupied and the fermi level is not in the gap. This problem is terrible on the panel in the extreme left for pure Antimony, which is really a semimetal with overlapping electron and hole bands. In this case, independent of where the fermi level is the system would remain metallic. Moving from pure Sb to $Bi_2 Se_3$ improves this somewhat, but still does not make this an insulator. Theoretically, we do expect pure $Bi_2 Se_3$ to be an insulator - on the other hand, the system typically appears to have Se vacancies, which make the system metallic.\n",

By looking at the ARPES spectra, it should look convincing that by varying different conditions, the fermi level is indeed shifting in to the interior of the gap. The experimental tricks used to get this working range between changing the pressure of various elements in the growth condition to counter doping the surface etc.  But the resistance results seem to be improving quite a bit."
