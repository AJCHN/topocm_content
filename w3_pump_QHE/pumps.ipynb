The reflection amplitude is always 1, but the reflection phase advanced by $2\\pi$ as the energy of this level goes from a positive to a negative value. If the reservoir is finite, by emptying the resonant level we would add an extra level to the reservoir, and that requires incrementing the phase of all the levels by $2\\pi$."
