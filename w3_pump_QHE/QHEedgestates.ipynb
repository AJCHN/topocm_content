      "* We can apply an electric field  $E_y$ along the circumference of the cylinder by changing the vector potential using the relation $\\partial_t A_y=E_y$ (as in the last unit). The Hamiltonian of the system is now time-dependent as $$H(k_y,t)\\equiv H(k_y-e A_y/c)=H(k_y-e E_y t/c).$$ This effectively implies that the momentum of the electrons along the circumference of the cyilnder change as $$k_y\\rightarrow k_y-e E_y t/\\hbar,\\quad\\leftrightarrow\\quad \\frac{dp_y}{dt}=e E_y.$$ Physically, the above relation can be interpreted as effectively the Lorentz force-law.\n",

      "* The quantum Hall system is a many-electron system where electrons are filled up to the chemical potential $\\mu$, which is chosen to be in between two Landau level energies $$n \\hbar\\omega_c <\\mu< (n+1)\\hbar \\omega_c.$$ Since all the electrons in the bulk are quantized near the Landau levels (for clean systems), the electrons at the fermi level which can respond to the electric field are at the chemical potential are all in the chiral edge states of the cylinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Focusing on the electrons near the chemical potential $\\mu$, we expand the Hamiltonian near one of the edges for a small range of energy to linear order in $k_y$ as  $$E_n(k_y)=\\mu+v_n(k_{y,c})(k_y-k_{F}),$$ where the electrons at the edge move with velocity $v_n(k_y)=\\partial_{k_y} E_n(k_y)$. The wave-vector $k_{F}$ where $E_n(k_{F})=\\mu$ is referred to as a Fermi wave-vector.  the density of electrons $n=$ This is a standard low-energy approximation for the chiral edge Hamiltonian that is frequently useful to understand the response of the system to weak perturbations.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Applying an electric field $E_y$ to this Hamiltonian for a short time $\\delta t$ the energy of the electron changes from $$E_n(k_y)=v k_y\\rightarrow E_n(k_y+e E_y\\delta t)=v k_y+e E_y \\delta t v.$$ In particular electrons at the chemical potential $\\mu$ get pushed to higher chemical potential $\\mu+e E_y \\delta t v$. Thus the chemical potential of the edge increases as $$\\partial_t \\mu(t)=e E_y v.$$ Correspondingly the fermi wave-vector $k_F$ also increases as $\\partial_t k_F= e E_y/\\hbar.$ Since the allowed values of $k_y$ on the cylinder are discretized in units of $(2\\pi R)^{-1}$, the change in fermi wave-vector $k_F$ is also related to changes in density in the system as  $\\delta n = \\delta k_F$. We note that the reason we speak only of the changes in density $\\delta n$ is because to assign a density to the edge we would need to partition electrons into bulk and edge which is not strictly speaking possible. However, since the added electrons are localized at the edge we can discuss the change in density.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Since the spectrum of the cylinder is restored when one unit $\\Phi_0$ of flux is entered in the cylinder, the increased fermi -wavevector implies that the number of electrons at the edge also increases in response to the electric field as $$\\partial_t \\delta n=\\partial_t k_F=e E_y/\\hbar.$$\n",

      "> The relation $\\partial_t n=e E_y/\\hbar$, which happens for a chiral edge state is referred to as the chiral anomaly. This contradicts the conservation of charge $n$ of an isolated system, which forces the total number density $n$ to be independent of time. This can happen in the quantum hall system because the charge appearing at one edge is depleted from the other edge. Thus, chiral edge states or anything else that exhibits a \"chiral anomaly\" are an example of the \"bulk edge correspondence\" since they can only appear at the edge of a two dimensional system and never in isolation."

Since the edges both contribute to the Hall current in the perpendicular direction, the Hall current is written as $$I_H=\\sum_{p=1}^n I_{L,p}-I_{R,p}=\\sum_{p=1}^n\\frac{e^2}{h}V=\\frac{n e^2}{h}V.$$ \n",

This is a model of a quantum hall phase transition.\n",

      "* An important question that our discussion so far has left unanswered is whether this physics is robust to arbitrary perturbations such as disorder. This question is somewhat complicated and will have to wait till 9.1 to answer completely, though we will be able to understand periodic perturbations next week. However, it should be clear that the strictly topological features such as the bulk edge correspondence arising from the chiral edge states will survive disorder. On the other hand features such as all the bulk Landau levels being at exactly the same energy, are in some sense artifacts of the specific Hamiltonian we constructed and are destroyed, so that one obtains bulk Landau levels at a range of energies. This would suggest that there are ranges of chemical potential $\\mu$ in the bulk Landau levels where the system is gapless and therefore does not have a well-defined quantum number. This turns out to be false in a subtle way that requires a careful analysis of disorder that must be left for later."
