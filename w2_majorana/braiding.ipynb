Second, it is reasonable to assume that $U$ only depends on the Majoranas involved in the exchange, or in other words that it is a function of $\\gamma_n$ and $\\gamma_m$, and of no other operator.

This geometric constraint is not a big problem: by carefully composing many exchanges between neighbours, we can exchange any pair of Majoranas.

      "The non-Abelian statistics of Majorana modes is a very special property. Furthermore, it has some practical interest, since it could be used to realize a robust **quantum computer**. (If you are not yet interested in quantum computation, you can skip this part, even thought we suggest that you get interested in it! Quantum computation is a huge topic of research, but [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9708022) is a good place to start learning.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's discuss very briefly how this can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we can think of our network of nanowires with $2N$ Majoranas as a small computer. The $2^N$ states of the ground state manifold can encode a string of $N$ bits, so it's like having a small *register*. As always in quantum computation, and unlike in a classical computer, the register can be in a superposition of different states. So far, nothing really special about Majoranas.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we execute an *algorithm* on our register? Simply by exchanging the Majorana modes! Because of the non-Abelian statistics, different sequences of exchanges will yield different algorithms. Of course, to execute an interesting algorithm we may need a lot of Majorana modes and a very very long sequence of exchanges. However, it all begins with the small building blocks, the matrices that you have just studied in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might say that this is just another way to obtain a given unitary operator acting on the wave function. The beautiful thing, though, is that both the state of the register and the algorithms are *topologically protected*. Let's explain what we mean by that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state of the register is encoded in the fermion parity degrees of freedom, which are shared *non-locally* by the Majoranas. This means that no local perturbation can change the state of the register and cause *decoherence* of the quantum state. The environment cannot access the information stored in the Majoranas, as long as they are kept far away from each other. The only exception is a change in fermion parity due to the tunnelling of a stray quasiparticle into the system (this is the problem of quasiparticle posioning, the same that can hinder the detection of the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect of Majorana modes, as you heard from Carlo Beenakker). But except from this, the Majoranas are a great *quantum memory*.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, every step of the algorithm will be extremely accurate because it is given by an exchange of two Majoranas, which corresponds to *exactly* $\\exp(\\pi\\gamma_n\\gamma_m/4)$. When you are in the adiabatic limit, this operator does not depend on any of the deatils on how the exchange between Majoranas is performed. It does not depend on *how* you move the Majoranas, or on the particular trajectory that $\\gamma_n$ and $\\gamma_n$ followed, or on the timing of the trajectory. So the final result is extremely reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the basic ideas of **topological quantum computation**. It is incredible that we can find condensed matter systems, such as networks of Majoranas, which are naturally endowed with these characteristics. "
