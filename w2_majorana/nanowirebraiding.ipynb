      "In the drawing, you can see a nanowire with many T-shaped junctions in between several Majorana zero modes (which is why we call it a network). We will not worry about the microscopic description of the nanowire network. In fact, such a network could be realized in several ways, for instance it could be done by arranging magnetic atoms on the surface of a superconductor. Just to fix the ideas, you can imagine that the system can be effectively described by the Kitaev chain toy-model, and that Majoranas at the positions of domain walls where the gap changes sign, as you have seen in the first week of the course.\n",

      "The only thing that distinguishes Majorana zero modes is their position in the network. They have no other \u201cflavour\u201d that would allow us to characterize them. They are identical to each other, just like all electrons are identical to each other. If we exchanged two Majoranas in space, the system after the exchange would look exactly the same as it looked before the exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very interesting to ask what is the behaviour of the quantum state $\\left|\\Psi\\right\\rangle$ of a system of identical particles under the exchange of two of the particles. You already know that for bosons and fermions $\\left|\\Psi\\right\\rangle\\,\\to\\,\\pm\\left|\\Psi\\right\\rangle$. To see what happens in the case of Majoranas, we first have to learn how to write down the quantum state $\\left|\\Psi\\right\\rangle$ corresponding to a set of Majoranas like the one sketched above.\n",

      "From now on, it is important to keep in mind that by considering only the states corresponding to the Majorana zero modes, we are neglecting the existence of the states that live in the bulk. As mentioned in the video, we assume that the energy spectrum looks like this:\n",

      "Now, this description is not completely exact. Because the domain walls are only separated by a finite distance $L$, the wavefunctions corresponding to the Majorana modes overlap, leading to a finite splitting $\\delta$ of the states from zero. However, this energy $\\delta$ goes to zero exponentially fast as a function of $L$, $\\delta\\propto \\exp(-L/\\xi)$. Here $\\xi$ is a length scale that depends on the microscopic details of the system. On the other hand, the energy gap $\\Delta$ is independent of (or depends very very weakly on) the separation $L$ between domain walls. Therefore, it is always possible (at least conceptually!) to imagine a situation where $\\delta$ is completely negligible with respect to $\\Delta$. That is, it is physically well motivated to consider the limit $\\delta\\to 0$ and $\\Delta\\to\\infty$. We imagine we are precisely in this situation, and that all the states corresponding to the Majoranas are precisely at zero energy, in other words that they are *degenerate*.\n",

      "* Operations on the register are performed by exchanging Majorana modes in space.\n",
      "* Initalization and measurement of the register entries are carried out by bringing two Majorana modes very close to each other, an operation called \\emph{fusion}. When this happens, the ground state degeneracy splits, allowing for a readout of the fermion parity of the two joint Majorana modes.\n",

      "* The quantum gates which can be executed via braiding are extremely accurate and do not depend on the exact trajectory followed during the exchange. In this sense, they are extremely resilient to implementation inaccuracies.\n",
      "* The quantum state of the register is encoded in the fermion parity degrees of freedom, which are shared non-locally by the Majorana modes. This means that no local perturbation can change the state of the register and cause decoherence. The only exception is a change in fermion parity due to the tunnelling of a stray quasiparticle into the system (quasiparticle poisoning).\n",

      "A crucial question in topological quantum computation is whether braiding operations are universal, in the sense that any unitary operation on the register can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a finite sequence of braiding operations. Unfortunately, this is not the case for Majorana modes. In this case, braiding operation have to be supplemented by non-topological ones.\n"
